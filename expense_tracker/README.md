# hw1- Manual Review

The homework will be based on this project named "Expense Tracker",where users will be able to add/remove daily transaction. 

## Compile

To compile the code from terminal, use the following command:
```
cd src
javac ExpenseTrackerApp.java
java ExpenseTracker
```

You should be able to view the GUI of the project upon successful compilation. 

## Java Version
This code is compiled with ```openjdk 17.0.7 2023-04-18```. Please update your JDK accordingly if you face any incompatibility issue.

## Filters

At the bottom of the GUI, there are 2 filters:
1. Amount filter
2. Category filter

To filter the transactions based on amount, enter the amount you want to filter
in the Amount text field next to the "Filter Amount" button. Then, click on the
"Filter Amount" button to filter the transactions.

To filter the transactions based on category, enter the category you want to filter
in the Category text field next to the "Filter Category" button. Then, click on the
"Filter Category" button to filter the transactions.

In both cases, the filtered transactions will be highlighted in green. To remove the
filter, click on the "Reset" button.
