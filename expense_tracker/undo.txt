Implementing the undo functionality

The `JTable` class has a `getSelectedRows()` method that returns an array of integers
representing the rows that are currently selected.

We can create a new button called the "Undo" button, such that when it is clicked,
we call the `getSelectedRows()` method to get list of rows that need to be 
deleted from the table.

Now, we can create a `deleteTransactions()` method in the controller class that
takes in an array of integers representing the rows that need to be deleted, and
calls the `removeTransaction()` method for each transaction corresponding to the
given indices.

Once the transactions have been deleted, the `deleteTransactions()` method will
call the `refresh()` method to update the view so that the changes are reflected
in the UI for the user.
